        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m a 17 year old high school student that goes to Arise High in Oakland, CA. I have many goals and interests from many different fields. I love animals, medicine, technology and Science.</p>
        <p>I have showed my interest in these topics by taking many classes and enrolling in programs centered around these topics. As of now I have applied to various colleges for a couple different majors that are similar to my interest and I hope to hear back from some of them so I can pursue a career in a field that is interesting for me.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I'd like to go to college so I can further my education and so one day I can have a job I love doing. Some fields I am interested in are:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Video Game Development</li>
          <li>Veterninary Science</li>
          <li>Coding Science</li>
          <li>Pharmaceutical Science</li>
          <li>Zoology</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’d like to learn more about coding as I find it interesting despite me not being the greatest at it. My interest in the medical field sprouted from my liking of animals and also my desire to help others</p>
